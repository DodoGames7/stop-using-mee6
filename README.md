# stop-using-mee6

mee6 have been for a long time ago since early discord days, an popular discord bot with tons of features such as level rewards, music, birthday, and etc however as time went on more features are moved to premium causing people to find many alternatives including many controversies this year, in fact there're many hates around the bot and there's even an [website](https://www.alternativestomee6.com/) that helps people on how to move away from mee6 itself, first of all i will address some issues regarding their stuff here

# premium ✅
mee6 premium was launched for a long time ago and a lot of people did not care much about it but however it seems that mee6 started moving all features to premium, this isn't an issue if your server is small but if it was public and as time went on where it grows larger over and over again then you would have to use alternatives, for example level rewards was previously free but it's now completely locked behind premium program, same thing with youtube notifications feature, it was previously free but locked behind premium program and other features if i'm correct

# mee6 nft ✅
on early 2022 (especially january 2022) they launched their nft thingy which was not expected to a lot of people and this caused an very massive chaos into their support server that they even had to delete the entire chat channel, but there can be reason on why there are hates about this, nft can be used by any scammer to complete their evil plan and get tons of money without issue by just scamming, there are also other reasons on why nft is not an good thing in general

# unsolicited emails 🔍
there has been complaints regarding mee6 advertisements via their email into people's email's inbox, according to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/panley01/status/1515487554107236353) it was violating discord's [developer policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy) but however discord hasn't did anything to mee6 for unknown reasons till this day
