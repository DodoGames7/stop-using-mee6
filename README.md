# important
this repo is not meant to make mee6 developers bad or anything like that, there is an clearly reason on why they're forcing premium, while i understand that they're working hard however it remains that i should address my concerns regarding the bot itself there so you can understand me on why i dodge it all the time

# stop-using-mee6

mee6 have been for a long time ago since early discord days, an popular discord bot with tons of features such as level rewards, music, birthday, and etc however as time went on more features are moved to premium causing people to find many alternatives including many controversies this year, in fact there're many hates around the bot and there's even an [website](https://www.alternativestomee6.com/) that helps people on how to move away from mee6 itself, first of all i will address some issues regarding their stuff here

# mee6 nft
on early 2022 (especially january 2022) they launched their nft thingy which was not expected to a lot of people and this caused an very massive chaos into their support server that they even had to delete the entire chat channel, but there can be reason on why there are hates about this, nft can be used by any scammer to complete their evil plan and get tons of money without issue by just scamming, there are also other reasons on why nft is not an good thing in general

# unsolicited emails
there has been complaints regarding mee6 advertisements via their email into people's email's inbox, according to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/panley01/status/1515487554107236353) it was violating discord's [developer policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy) but however discord hasn't did anything to mee6 for unknown reasons till this day
